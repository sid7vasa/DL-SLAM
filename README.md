### A few points about this repository:
- We have used code from GTSAM, PyICPSlam to build our base SLAM model. 
- We used PCRNET code as the starting point. We wrote various scripts and defined custom models and performed analysis.
- We collected CARLA data using the carla python client.
- We integrated PyGame with CARLA to control data collection.
- We have written code to handle various data processing strategies, metrics calculation, visualizations to aid our development process.
